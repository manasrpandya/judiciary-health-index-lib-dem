## Index to measure Judiciary Health
Kindly find the code works in the main dir as the .py files in python. 
the index.html is the necessary file to host the interactive map on the site :[https://manasrpandya.github.io/judiciary-health-index-lib-dem/](url)
Note you will need the folder named **new** for generating and hosting the map.

Thanks!
